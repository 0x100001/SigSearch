# SigSearch
A simple YARA UI based on C#.

Did this quickly for some administrator. Enables you to quickly perform yara scans including a simple rule editor. Please be aware of some limitations. Take a look on the code.

You can either scan a directory or the process executable. Make sure to follow the yara documentation for correct usage.
